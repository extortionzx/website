      <p>Welcome to Extortion, a pretty awesome website made for ROBLOX. Here at Extortion, we seek to give users a fun and amazing experience placing bounties on players across the ROBLOX platform in order to make the game more fun and exciting.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We made this website for the purpose of gathering players in a fun and exciting way. After all, its a game and games are meant to be fun, extreme and challenging. By giving the ability for users to place bounties, it creates an amazing and competitive atmosphere full of action and great players.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Extortion is for entertainment purposes only. Please be respectful and responsible when using this and have a good time. We here at Extortion believe in fairness and fun and will continue to work towards a great community.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Should a bounty setter not provide the agreed-upon reward upon completion of the bounty, we will take appropriate measures to resolve the issue. We cannot guarantee specific outcomes, but we will do our best to investigate the matter thoroughly in order to reach a resolution. Depending on the circumstances, actions such as penalties, warnings or restrictions may need to be taken against the violator so as to maintain the integrity of our platform. Furthermore, we realize that this could inconvenience the player who finished the job, therefore we promise to come up with an adequate and just solution by maybe giving compensatory rewards among other forms of restitution. We want everyone using our services to have fun and feel fairly treated; please help us make sure that happens.
